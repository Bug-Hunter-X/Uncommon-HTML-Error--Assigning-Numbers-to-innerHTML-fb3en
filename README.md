This repository showcases a subtle bug in HTML involving the improper use of innerHTML. The `bug.html` file demonstrates the error, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version. The issue arises from attempting to directly assign a numeric value to the innerHTML property, which expects a string.  This can cause unexpected behavior in web browsers, often resulting in silent failure or exceptions. The solution shows how to properly convert the numeric value to a string before assigning it to innerHTML.
